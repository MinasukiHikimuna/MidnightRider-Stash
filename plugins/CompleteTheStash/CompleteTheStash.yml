# Uncomment the following hooks if you want missing scenes to be updated
# whenever you update scenes in the main Stash. Note that this will cause each
# scene update to take a couple of seconds, which is significantly longer than
# without these hooks. The slowdown is due to each scene update starting the
# plugin separately and connecting to multiple Stash instances.
